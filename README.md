### Description

This is a game similar to DX-Ball or Breakout, where you have to break the bricks by bouncing a ball off your paddle. I have made 5 levels so far, and hope to include sound and powerups eventually. Many snippets of code have come from this site and others, so I am putting this program up for everyones benefit. Please leave any comments or questions!
 
### More Info
 
This is somewhat advanced code, so if your a newbie dont expect to understand it right away.

None known.
